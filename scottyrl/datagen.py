"""Trajectory -> training data. *** STUDENT IMPLEMENTATION FILE ***

The heart of the data pipeline: turning a multi-turn episode into stitched
token sequences with correct masking, logprob alignment, and advantage
broadcasting. Read the TokenSequence docstring in `scottyrl/types.py`
carefully before starting, especially the off-by-one: position j of
mask/logprobs/advantages describes the *target* token tokens[j+1].

Implement the three functions below. You may add private helpers in this
file, but these signatures must not change.

    """Stitch an episode's LLM calls into training sequences.

    Output contract:
      - Walk the calls in order, maintaining one growing token sequence of
        context tokens (prompt + rendered env observations) interleaved with
        completion tokens. A call whose prompt extends the sequence built so
        far continues it: only the new context suffix is appended before the
        call's completion. A call that breaks the extension property ends the
        current sequence and starts a new one from that call's full prompt.
      - In every emitted TokenSequence: mask is 1 at exactly the target
        positions whose token came from a completion; logprobs carries the
        sampling logprob at those positions and 0.0 everywhere else;
        advantages is all zeros at this stage.
      - Never emit a sequence with fewer than 2 tokens or with no action
        (mask == 1) positions; there would be nothing to train on.

    Example -- two calls whose prompts extend:
        call 0: prompt=[10, 11], completion=[20, 21], logprobs=[-0.2, -0.3]
        call 1: prompt=[10, 11, 20, 21, 30], completion=[40], logprobs=[-0.4]

    Before call 1, the accumulated sequence is [10, 11, 20, 21], so only
    prompt suffix [30] is appended. The single result is:

        tokens     = [10, 11, 20, 21, 30, 40]
        targets    =      [11, 20, 21, 30, 40]  (= tokens[1:])
        mask       =      [ 0,  1,  1,  0,  1]
        logprobs   =      [0.0, -0.2, -0.3, 0.0, -0.4]
        advantages =      [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

    Example -- the second prompt breaks the extension property:
        call 0: prompt=[10, 11], completion=[20, 21]
        call 1: prompt=[10, 11, 30], completion=[40]

    Since [10, 11, 20, 21] is not a prefix of call 1's prompt, this emits two
    results. Their tokens and masks are:

        tokens=[10, 11, 20, 21], mask=[0, 1, 1]
        tokens=[10, 11, 30, 40], mask=[0, 0, 1]
